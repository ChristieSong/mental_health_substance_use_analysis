This repository contains cleaned datasets and R scripts for an R Shiny app for the study "Analysis of Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders Pre- and Post-COVID-19." Using GSS, MH-CLD, and N-SUMHSS data, we examine trends in depression, substance use, and treatment availability (2018â€“2022) with visualizations.
